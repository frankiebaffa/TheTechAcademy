EXPECTATIONS:
    Your HTML/CSS/JavaScript will need to present the menu and
    retrieve the patron's selection and return an invoiced receipt
    to the user's screen with their total purchase price once they press
    an "Order" button.
    The client is not particular about the aesthetics and images are
    not required. Therefore, you have full freedom on the front end
    design. However, they are sticklers about menu functionality.
